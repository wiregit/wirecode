/**
 * Paints a rounded border like box with one pixel inner 
 *  shadowing/beveling.  Used a the base painter of almost
 *  all components.
 * <p> 
 *  
 * NOTE: This painter does NOT use resources for
 *        the colours defined by the accents.  This
 *        is the most commonly used painter in the 
 *        application and the idea was to keep it as 
 *        simple as possible.  If resources are desired
 *        the class must be refactored with a factory.
 *        This class MUST NOT import resources directly
 *        since it is used early in the startup cycle.
