  - added following mapping in 
    components/resources/src/main/resources/org/limewire/gui/resources/icon_mapping.properties:
	LIBRARY_BROWSER_BACK=browser_back
	LIBRARY_BROWSER_STOP=stop
	LIBRARY_BROWSER_HOME=browser_home
	LIBRARY_BROWSER_NEXT=browser_forward

* buy button
  - added ResultNameHolderRenderer to render names and possibly add
    buy buttons
  - change ResultNameHolder to have a getter for the TableLine
  - added isCellEditable to the TableRowFilter to allow cells to be
    edited so we can get the buttons clips

* messages
  -labeled with Browser LIBRARY_BROWSER_*
  - MENU_NAV_STORE_*

* new scheme in schemas/xml/schemas
  - store.xsd

* new tab in gui.tabs
  - MainFrame.buildTabs()
  - new value in GUIMediator.Tabs

* questions + todo
  - how to get store.xsd in the right place
  - how to create the LimeXMLSchema for store
  - copied jdic browser exes to gui and lib/jars
  
* misc
  - if there isn't an icon in lib/xml/misc for a schema in
    lib/xml/schemas then the schema box won't show that kind of media
    type

* menus over browser
  - added JPopupMenu.setDefaultLightWeightPopupEnabled(false); in
    AbstractMenu to make sure menu items didn't cover up the browser

* buttons in TableLines
  - added 'Buy' and 'Try' buttons to TableLines
  - created a special composite cell editor and renderer for
    ResultNameHolders and a new type of Panel that contained a label
    and buttons for displaying ResultNameHolders.  In the case where
    the TableLines *where't* from the store, they are not editable and
    displayed using just the cell renderer side of the composite.
