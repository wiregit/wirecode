# Default locale for: English - United States
# Maintained by the LimeWire project team.

#####################################################################################
# GENERAL TIPS THAT ARE SHOWN ON ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS
#####################################################################################
GENERAL_1=Tired of downloads stopping halfway through? It helps to pick search results that have a higher number in the '#' column. The # is the amount of unique places on the network that are hosting the file. The more sources, the better the chance of getting your file!
GENERAL_2=When your downloads say 'Needs More Sources', try choosing that download and then clicking 'Find More Sources'. LimeWire will search the network for more places to download the file and automatically resume downloading if it finds any matches.
#GENERAL_3 not used -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX.
GENERAL_4=When LimeWire starts up it has to connect to the network.  During this time, the bar in the bottom-left corner will change colors.  Once all bars are green (or blue!), LimeWire has completely connected.
GENERAL_5=You can change the look and feel of LimeWire by going to View -> Apply Skins and choosing a new skin. Brand new skins are on LimeWire's website, available by choosing 'Get More Skins'. If you download skins by the "Download into LimeWire" links, LimeWire will automatically ask if you want to use the new skin when the download completes.
GENERAL_6=You can sort your search results by clicking on a column. The most useful column to sort by is the '#' column, which can put the results that have the highest chance of downloading at the top of the list.
#GENERAL_7 not used -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX.
GENERAL_8=The more stars a search result has, the better the chances of the download completing successfully! Some search results may even appear with four blue stars and a speed of 'Ethernet'. These results have the greatest chance of completing successfully.
GENERAL_9=You can find out how many times someone has uploaded a file by choosing the 'Library' tab and looking at the Uploads column. The information is listed as 'X / Y', where 'Y' is the number of people that have attempted to upload that file, and 'X' is the number of people that have successfully uploaded it.
GENERAL_10=Curious how many people are searching for your files? The 'hits' column in the Library will count how many times LimeWire has returned a result from someone searching for that file.
GENERAL_11=It helps the network if you keep your LimeWire running. Others will connect to the network easier and searches will perform better.
GENERAL_12=Looking for something rare? The more detailed your search is, the better your chances of getting a result you want!
GENERAL_13=Want to open this Tip Of The Day dialog after you've closed it? Go to the Help menu and choose 'Tip of the Day'.
GENERAL_14=LimeWire displays the speed and location of the host who returned a search result. Speeds that are green mean that LimeWire was able to verify the speed is correct. Locations that are red mean the host is firewalled. Choosing results with green speeds and black locations is your best bet for a good download.
GENERAL_15=When LimeWire says your download is "Waiting In Line," that means that source you are downloading from is temporarily busy and has queued your download. In order to successfully complete your download, wait while your request advances in line and is eventually serviced.
GENERAL_16=Need more help? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.com/forum.htm">our message boards</a> and see if others have already answered your question! You can also review the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/faq">FAQ</a> for answers to commonly asked questions or the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/userguide">User Guide</a> for more information.
GENERAL_17=Accidentally killed your download? Click the library tab, choose the Incomplete folder, and then highlight the filename of the file you'd like to resume downloading and click resume. LimeWire will automatically search for that file and begin downloading it again.
GENERAL_18=Do you have a tip for effectively using LimeWire? Mail it to totd@limewire.com and it may make it into future Tips of the Day!
#GENERAL_19 unused -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX.
#GENERAL_20 unused -- was duplicated as GENERAL_29
GENERAL_21=You can restart downloads that say 'Awaiting Sources' by searching for that file again. LimeWire will automatically restart the download if it finds any matching results.
GENERAL_22=Do you have a cool feature you'd like to see added to LimeWire? Suggest it on LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.com/forum.htm">message boards</a> and it may be added to future versions!
GENERAL_23=You can make your own LimeWire skins! Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/makeskins.shtml">LimeWire's website</a> for detailed information about how skins are created.
GENERAL_24=Want to know more about the development of LimeWire? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.org">LimeWire's open-source website</a> and look around!
GENERAL_25=You can preview downloaded files to make sure they're what you expect. Just select the download and click 'Preview'!
#GENERAL_26 unused -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX.
GENERAL_27=Curious what hosts LimeWire is connecting or connected to? Enable the Connections tab from View -> Show/Hide, and take a look at LimeWire's connections.
GENERAL_28=You can chat with other people who are running LimeWire. Choose any download or search result that has a smiley in the Chat column and then click 'Chat'.
GENERAL_29=Sometimes the 'Search' button is disabled. This happens when LimeWire is not connected to any other hosts. Choose File -> Connect and wait for the bar in the bottom-left corner to fill up.
GENERAL_30=Passionate about digital rights? Visit the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and see what you can do to help.
GENERAL_31=LimeWire is translated into dozens of <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/international.shtml">different languages</a> including Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and many more. Visit LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.org/translate.shtml">internationalization page</a> for information on how you can help translation efforts!
GENERAL_32=Can't find files you've downloaded? Try doing a search on your computer for the filename. LimeWire will only list files that are being shared or are incomplete within its Library, so if your Save directory isn't shared, LimeWire won't display it.
GENERAL_33=Sport the LimeWire look! Visit our <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/gear.shtml">LimeWire gear</a> page and purchase a t-shirt or hat! 
GENERAL_34=Want to publish your own content? <a href="http://www.magnetmix.com">LimeWire's MagnetMix</a> offers independent artists, shareware games, software distributors and more a way to reach large audiences. <a href="http://www.magnetmix.com/form.html">Submit your content</a> today!
GENERAL_35=Try an audio genre search!<br>Click on the 'Audio' Metadata search window, choose a genre from the drop-down box, and then press 'Search'. Most if not all of the files returned will be from the selected genre.
GENERAL_36=Don't know what to look for? Try a "What's New" search and see what's recently been added to the network.

# TIPS FOR NON-OSX Machines (Useful for tips that reference the About Window or the Preferences Window, or right-clicking)
#####################################################################################
NOT_OSX_1=Are you using a router? Be sure to use 'port forwarding' so that other people can make incoming connections to your computer! You can configure LimeWire to be aware of port forwarding by choosing:<br>Tools -> Options -> Advanced:Port/Firewalls.<br>Review your router's configuration to set it up correctly.
NOT_OSX_2=You can customize LimeWire to your heart's content by changing various preferences such as your Save Directory, Shared Directory, Upload Bandwidth, etc... These preferences (and more) are available at the Tools -> Options menu.
NOT_OSX_3=You can find out which version of LimeWire you are using by choosing 'About LimeWire' from the Help menu.
NOT_OSX_4=Be a good network participant, don't close LimeWire if someone is uploading from you. You can tell LimeWire to automatically close after all downloads and uploads are complete by going to Tools -> Options and looking at the 'Shutdown' options.
NOT_OSX_5=LimeWire does not automatically share all types of files. If you have a specific file you'd like to share, make sure its extension is being shared. This can be done via Tools -> Options and altering the 'Sharing' options.
NOT_OSX_6=Frequently see 'Could Not Move To Library' on downloads? You can fix this by making sure a valid save directory exists in Tools -> Options, Saving.
NOT_OSX_7=You can turn autocomplete for searching on or off by choosing 'Options' from the 'Tools' menu, and changing the value of 'Autocomplete Text' under the 'View' option.
NOT_OSX_8=Want to see dialogs for questions which you previously marked 'Do not display this message again' or 'Always Use This Answer'? Go to Tools -> Options, and check 'Revert To Default' under View -> Popups.
NOT_OSX_9=You can ban certain words from appearing in your search results by choosing 'Options' from the 'Tools' menu and adding new words to those listed under Filters -> Keywords.
NOT_OSX_10=You can change the columns that display search result information. Columns you can choose include, 'Title', 'Genre', 'Track', 'Length', and many more. Just right-click on the search result column headers, choose audio or video, and check the columns you want to see!
NOT_OSX_11=Hate tool tips? Love tool tips?  You can turn them on or off in most tables by right-clicking on the column headers and choosing 'More Options'.  You can toggle other options here too, like whether or not to sort tables automatically and if you prefer the rows to be striped.
NOT_OSX_12=You can sort uploads, downloads, etc..., by clicking on a column. The table keeps resorting as the information changes. You can turn this automatic-sorting behavior off by right-clicking on a column header, choosing 'More Options' and un-checking 'Sort Automatically'.
NOT_OSX_13=Don't want to see the Chat (or other) columns in downloads? Right-click on the column headers and uncheck that column. You can also drag the columns around to make them appear in the order you'd like.
NOT_OSX_14=You can tell LimeWire which downloads to start next. Right-click on the column headers in the download area and check the 'Priority' column. Select the download you want to start next and click the up arrow until it's at the top!
