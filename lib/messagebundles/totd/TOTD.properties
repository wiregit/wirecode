# Tips of the Day for LimeWire 4.14
# Default locale for: English - United States
# Maintained by the LimeWire project team.
################################################################################
##################################################################################### 
# GENERAL TIPS THAT ARE SHOWN ON ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS 
##################################################################################### 
GENERAL_1=Tired of downloads stopping halfway through? It helps to pick search results with a higher number in the '#' column. The # is the amount of unique places on the network that are hosting the file. The more sources, the better the chance of getting your file! In case a junk result appears to have a lot of sources, use the 'Junk' button to train LimeWire's junk filter. 
GENERAL_2=When your downloads say 'Needs More Sources', try choosing that download and then clicking 'Find More Sources'. LimeWire will search the network for more places to download the file and automatically resume downloading if it finds any matches. 
#GENERAL_3 not used -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX. 
GENERAL_4=When LimeWire starts up it has to connect to the network. During this time, the bar in the bottom-left corner will change colors. Once all bars are green (or blue!), LimeWire has completely connected. 
GENERAL_5=You can change the look and feel of LimeWire by going to View -> Apply Skins and choosing a new skin. Brand new skins are on LimeWire's website, available by choosing 'Get More Skins'. If you download skins by the "Download into LimeWire" links, LimeWire will automatically ask if you want to use the new skin when the download completes. 
GENERAL_6=You can sort your search results by clicking on a column. The most useful column to sort by is the '#' column, which can put the results that have the highest chance of downloading at the top of the list. 
#GENERAL_7 not used -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX. 
GENERAL_8=The more stars a search result has, the better the chances of the download completing successfully! Some search results may even appear with four blue stars and a speed of 'Ethernet'. These results have the greatest chance of completing successfully. 
GENERAL_9=You can find out how many times someone has uploaded a file by choosing the 'Library' tab and looking at the Uploads column. The information is listed as 'X / Y', where 'Y' is the number of people that have attempted to upload that file, and 'X' is the number of people that have successfully uploaded it. 
GENERAL_10=Curious how many people are searching for your files? The 'hits' column in the Library will count how many times LimeWire has returned a result from someone searching for that file. 
GENERAL_11=It helps the network if you keep your LimeWire running. Others will connect to the network easier and searches will perform better. 
GENERAL_12=Looking for something rare? The more detailed your search is, the better your chances of getting a result you want! 
GENERAL_13=Want to open this Tip Of The Day dialog after you've closed it? Go to the Help menu and choose 'Tip of the Day'. 
#GENERAL_14 unused -- uncertain implementation 
GENERAL_15=When LimeWire says your download is "Waiting In Line," that means that source you are downloading from is temporarily busy and has queued your download. In order to successfully complete your download, wait while your request advances in line and is eventually serviced. 
GENERAL_16=Need more help? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.org/forum/">our message boards</a> and see if others have already answered your question! You can also review the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/faq">FAQ</a> for answers to commonly asked questions or the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/userguide">User Guide</a> for more information. 
GENERAL_17=Accidentally killed your download? Click the library tab, choose the Incomplete folder, and then highlight the filename of the file you'd like to resume downloading and click resume. LimeWire will automatically search for that file and begin downloading it again. 
GENERAL_18=Do you have a tip for effectively using LimeWire? Add it to <a href="http://www.limewire.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tips_Of_The_Day">the wiki</a> and it may make it into future Tips of the Day! 
#GENERAL_19 unused -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX. 
#GENERAL_20 unused -- was duplicated as GENERAL_29 
GENERAL_21=You can restart downloads that say 'Awaiting Sources' by searching for that file again. LimeWire will automatically restart the download if it finds any matching results. 
GENERAL_22=Do you have a cool feature you'd like to see added to LimeWire? Suggest it on LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.org/forum/">message boards</a> and it may be added to future versions! 
GENERAL_23=You can make your own LimeWire skins! Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.com/features/skins/make.php">LimeWire's website</a> for detailed information about how skins are created. 
GENERAL_24=Want to know more about the development of LimeWire? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.org/">LimeWire's open-source website</a> and look around! 
GENERAL_25=You can preview downloaded files to make sure they're what you expect. Just select the download and click 'Preview'! 
#GENERAL_26 unused -- migrated to OSX & NOT_OSX. 
GENERAL_27=Curious what hosts LimeWire is connecting or connected to? Enable the Connections tab from View -> Show/Hide, and take a look at LimeWire's connections. 
GENERAL_28=You can chat with other people who are running LimeWire. Choose any download or search result that has a smiley in the Chat column and then click 'Chat'. 
#GENERAL_29 unused -- deprecated 
GENERAL_30=Passionate about digital rights? Visit the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/eff">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and see what you can do to help. 
GENERAL_31=LimeWire is translated into many different languages including Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and many more. Visit LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.org/translate.shtml">internationalization page</a> for information on how you can help translation efforts! 
#GENERAL_32 unused -- deprecated 
GENERAL_33=Sport the LimeWire look! Visit our <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/limewire">LimeWire gear</a> page and purchase a t-shirt or hat! 
#GENERAL_34 unused -- uncertain use 
GENERAL_35=Try an audio genre search!<br>Click on the 'Audio' Metadata search window, choose a genre from the drop-down box, and then press 'Search'. Most if not all of the files returned will be from the selected genre. 
GENERAL_36=Don't know what to look for? Try a "What's New" search and see what's recently been added to the network. 
GENERAL_37=Are you using a router? Be sure to add the port specified in LimeWire's settings to the firewall in the router, UDP and TCP, incoming and outgoing. Go to Advanced -> Firewall Config in LimeWire's Options window to find the port. Review your router's configuration to set it up correctly. 
GENERAL_38=Want to know more detailed information about the inner workings of LimeWire? You can view the same statistics that the developers use by choosing Tools -> Advanced -> Statistics, choosing 'Advanced', and opting to view Advanced Statistics. 
GENERAL_39=Did you know LimeWire is completely open-source? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.org">www.limewire.org</a> for information on how to join developer mailing lists or to review the code. 
GENERAL_40=Bombarded with nonsense search results? Select the search result, and then click the Junk button. As you mark search results as Junk or Not Junk, LimeWire learns what to block and what not to block. After a short training period, LimeWire automatically blocks most junk results. Try it! 
GENERAL_41=Small variations in the search title will still work. For example, if your buddy is sharing "Limers" but you searched for "The Limers", your buddy's file will still be found. 
GENERAL_42=Did you know? LimeWire supports two different peer-to-peer file sharing protocols: Gnutella and BitTorrent. 
GENERAL_43=To download a file with BitTorrent, just click a link to a .torrent file on the Web, or drag a .torrent file to LimeWire's Downloads section. 
GENERAL_44=Want to share a file on your desktop with LimeWire? Simply drag the file or folder from your desktop to the LimeWire Library. Select Individually Shared Files to see your newly shared file in the Library. 
GENERAL_45=Search results in LimeWire come from other users like you. Search results marked with a lock icon in the Quality column are official communications from Lime Wire, LLC. 
GENERAL_46=After starting a search, you can customize the three boxes on the left with titles like Media, Artist, and Album. You can change what these boxes show. Click the circle in the upper left corner of a box, and choose a new option from the menu. 
GENERAL_47=Do you want to browse your friend's LimeWire Library? Go to Search -> Direct Connect, then enter the ip address and port number of your friend's computer in the following format: "ip address:port". The port can be found in LimeWire's Options in the Advanced -> Firewall Config section. 
GENERAL_48=Want to know the recent files added to the shared network? Use "What's New" instead of "Keyword" search. 
GENERAL_49=If you try to download a file that you already have, LimeWire lets you know, even if the file has a different name. 
GENERAL_50=Curious what people are searching for? Go to the Monitor tab, and select Show Incoming Searches to see other people's search queries that are entering your LimeWire. Double-click an incoming query to perform a search for that keyword. 
GENERAL_51=Have a lot of files? Try an instant search at the top of the Library window. 
GENERAL_52=You can publish your original work on the Gnutella network with a Creative Commons license. Select the .ogg or .mp3 shared file in the Library and click the Publish button. Visit the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creative commons website</a> for more information. 
GENERAL_53=Have you downloaded a file with incomplete or totally wrong information about its contents? Select the file in the Library and click Describe. Edit the file's metadata to your heart's content. You can even edit many files at once by selecting more than one file before clicking Describe. 
GENERAL_54=Are you behind a firewall? At the bottom of LimeWire in the status bar, look for the globe. If there is a brick wall in front of it, your Internet connection is firewalled. 
GENERAL_55=Wondering how many files you are sharing? Look in LimeWire's status bar at the number in a green oval. A beige oval means LimeWire is still building your Library. A red oval means files are not being shared. 
GENERAL_56=The numbers next to the up and down arrows in the status bar at the bottom of LimeWire show how fast all of your files are downloading or uploading combined. 
GENERAL_57=Don't strain your eyes to use LimeWire! You can adjust the text size by going to View -> Increase Font Size. 
GENERAL_58=Instead of putting all your files in a single folder, LimeWire can automatically sort them by media type. In the Options > Saving window, select a Media Type like Audio, and click the Browse button. You can group files by media type in the Library even if all saved files are in one folder. 
GENERAL_59=LimeWire autocompletes what you type in the search box. To prevent autocompletion, open the Options window. Under View, choose Autocompletion. Uncheck the box Enable Autocompletion of Text Fields, and click OK. 
GENERAL_60=While LimeWire is running, your audio and video files are automatically shared with iTunes and other programs that support the DAAP protocol. You can disable this sharing in the Options window by going to iTunes > Sharing. 
GENERAL_61=Do you connect to the Internet both wired and wirelessly? At the same time? Just want LimeWire to use one of the connections? Piece of cake! You can change your network interface by going to Tools > Options > Advanced > Network Interface. 
GENERAL_62=Your search queries travel through a network of interconnected computers, which is why it takes time to receive all of the search results. LimeWire often takes shortcuts to deliver results faster, but if you think search results are blocked because your computer has problems with UDP packets, you can disable OOB (out-of-band) searching in the Options for more reliable results. 
GENERAL_63=If you own the copyright to a file that is being shared on the network, and you don't want it to be shared, you can have it filtered out of the network search results. <a href="http://www.limewire.com/about/copyright.php">More information</a> is available. 
GENERAL_64=Unlike other peer-to-peer file-sharing programs, LimeWire can transfer files even if both parties are behind a firewall. You don't have to do anything extra because it happens automatically! 
GENERAL_65=Start sharing files without knowing anything about how to configure a firewall! If you use the Windows firewall, LimeWire automatically adds itself to the list of exceptions. All this is done in the background to make your experience as smooth as possible. 
GENERAL_66=LimeWire uses a technology called DHT to help users better find rare files. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the DHT, make sure you are not behind a firewall, and leave LimeWire running for as long as possible. 
GENERAL_67=Want to share a large file? LimeWire supports file sizes up to 1 TB (terabyte). 
GENERAL_68=Want to be an Ultrapeer? Leave LimeWire running as long as possible. If you have a fast connection without a firewall, you will be promoted to Ultrapeer status after a while. Make sure that you have not disabled Ultrapeer capabilties in the Options. 
GENERAL_69=Curious about the inner workings of LimeWire? Go to View > Show/Hide > Console to see LimeWire's source code in action! (not for the faint of heart) 
GENERAL_70=Wondering if someone browsed your shared library? Go to View > Show/Hide > Logging to see the recent activity. 
GENERAL_71=Ultrapeers help the network by distributing only pertinent network traffic to the leaf nodes. 
GENERAL_72=Magnet links allow users to download files through LimeWire from a web page. When you put a magnet link on your web page (in the "href" attribute of anchor tags), and a user clicks the link, a download will start in LimeWire.
