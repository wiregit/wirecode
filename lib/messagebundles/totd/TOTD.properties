#####################################################################################
# GENERAL TIPS THAT ARE SHOWN ON ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS
#####################################################################################
GENERAL_1=Tired of downloads stopping halfway through? It helps to pick search results that have a higher number in the '#' column. The # is the amount of unique places on the network that are hosting the file. The more sources, the better the chance of getting your file!
GENERAL_2=When your downloads say 'Needs More Sources', try choosing that download and then clicking the 'Find More Sources' button. LimeWire will search the network for more places to download the file and automatically resume downloading if it finds any matches.
GENERAL_3=Hate tooltips? Love tooltips? You can turn them on or off in most tables by right-clicking on the column headers and choosing 'More Options'. You can toggle other options here too, like whether or not to sort tables automatically and if you want the rows to be striped.
GENERAL_4=When LimeWire starts up it has to search the network for other clients to connect to. During this connecting time, the light in the bottom-left corner may flash red or green. When it glows a steady green light, that means LimeWire has found stable connections.
GENERAL_5=You can change the look and feel of LimeWire by going to View -> Apply Themes and choosing a new theme. Brand new themes are on LimeWire's website, available by choosing 'Get More Themes'. If you download themes using the "magnet" links, they'll download within LimeWire and LimeWire will automatically ask if you want to use the new theme when the download completes.
GENERAL_6=You can sort your search results by clicking on a column. The most useful column to sort by is the '#' column, which can put the results that have the highest chance of downloading at the top of the list.
GENERAL_7=You can sort uploads, downloads, etc..., by clicking on a column. The table keeps resorting as the information changes. You can turn this automatic-sorting behavior off by right-clicking on a column header, choosing 'More Options' and un-checking 'Sort Automatically'.
GENERAL_8=The more stars a search result has, the better the chances of the download completing successfully! Some search results may even appear with four blue stars and a speed of 'Ethernet'. These results have the greatest chance of completing successfully.
GENERAL_9=You can find out how many times someone has uploaded a file by choosing the 'Library' tab and looking at the Uploads column. The information is listed as 'X / Y', where 'Y' is the number of people that have attempted to upload that file, and 'X' is the number of people that have successfully uploaded it.
GENERAL_10=Curious how many people are searching for your files? The 'hits' column in the Library will count how many times LimeWire has returned a result from someone searching for that file.
GENERAL_11=It helps the network if you keep your LimeWire running. Others will connect to the network easier and searches will perform better.
GENERAL_12=Looking for something rare? The more detailed your search is, the better your chances of getting a result you want!
GENERAL_13=Want to open this Tip Of The Day dialog after you've closed it? Go to the Help menu and choose 'Tip of The Day'.
GENERAL_14=LimeWire displays the speed and location of the host who returned a search result. Speeds that are green mean that LimeWire was able to verify the speed is correct. Locations that are red mean the host is firewalled. Choosing results with green speeds and black locations is your best bet for a good download.
GENERAL_15=When LimeWire says your download is "Waiting In Line," that means that source you are downloading from is temporarily busy and has queued your download. In order to successfully complete your download, wait while your request advances in line and is eventually serviced.
GENERAL_16=Need more help? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.com/forum.htm">our message boards</a> and see if others have already answered your question! You can also review the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/faq">FAQ</a> for answers to commonly asked questions or the <a href="http://www.limewire.com/userguide">User Guide</a> for more information.
GENERAL_17=Accidentally killed your download? Click the library tab, choose the Incomplete folder, and then highlight the filename of the file you'd like to resume downloading and click resume. LimeWire will automatically search for that file and begin downloading it again.
GENERAL_18=Do you have a tip for effectively using LimeWire? Mail it to totd@limewire.com and it may make it into future Tips of the Day!
GENERAL_19=You can change the columns that display search result information. Columns you can choose from include, 'Title', 'Genre', 'Track', 'Length', and many more. Just right-click on the search result column headers, choose audio or video, and check the columns you want to see!
GENERAL_20=Sometimes the 'search' button is disabled. This happens when LimeWire is not connected to any other hosts. Choose File -> Connect and wait for the light in the bottom left to glow a steady green.
GENERAL_21=You can restart downloads that say 'Awaiting Sources' by searching for that file again. LimeWire will automatically restart the download if it finds any matching results.
GENERAL_22=Do you have a cool feature you'd like to see added to LimeWire? Suggest it on LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.com/forum.htm">message boards</a> and it may be added to future versions!
GENERAL_23=You can make your own LimeWire skins! Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.com/makeskins">LimeWire's website</a> for detailed information about how skins are created.
GENERAL_24=Want to know more about the development of LimeWire? Visit <a href="http://www.limewire.org">LimeWire's open-source website</a> and look around!
GENERAL_25=You can preview downloaded files to make sure they're what you expect. Just select the download and click launch!
GENERAL_26=Don't want to see the Chat (or other) columns in downloads? Right-click on the column headers and uncheck that column. You can also drag the columns around to make them appear in the order you'd like.
GENERAL_27=Curious what hosts LimeWire is connecting or connected to? Enable the Connections tab from View -> Show/Hide, and take a look at LimeWire's connections.
GENERAL_28=You can chat other people who are running LimeWire. Choose any download or search result that has a smiley in the Chat column and then click Chat.
GENERAL_29=Sometimes the 'search' button is disabled. This happens when LimeWire is not connected to any other hosts. Choose File -> Connect and wait for the light in the bottom left to glow a steady green.
GENERAL_30=Passionate about digital rights? Visit the <a href="http://eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and see what you can do to help.
GENERAL_31=LimeWire is translated into dozens of <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/international.shtml">different languages</a> including Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Spanish and many many more. Visit LimeWire's <a href="http://www.limewire.org/project/www/translate.html">internationalization page</a> for information on how you can help translation efforts!
GENERAL_32=Can't find files you've downloaded? Try doing a search on your computer for the filename. LimeWire will only list files that are being shared or are incomplete within its Library, so if your Save directory isn't shared, LimeWire won't display it.
GENERAL_33=Sport the LimeWire look! Visit our <a href="http://www.limewire.com/english/content/gear.shtml">LimeWire gear</a> page and purchase a t-shirt or hat!

GENERAL_35=Try an audio genre search!<br>Click on the 'Audio' Metadata search window, choose a genre from the drop-down box, and then press Search.  Most if not all of the files returned will be from the selected genre.
