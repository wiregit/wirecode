This document is a listing of what needs to get done for the GUESS
implementation to be functional and ready for release:

Date Resolved: 

Decide on a rate of querying for the QueryUnicaster.  This may change the 
implementation drastically.

Current Status: The QueryUnicaster sleeps for 1/10th a second before
sending out queries.

Confirm that the GUESS setting in limewire.props controls all handling of
UDP traffic appropriately, i.e. if it is false no UDP traffic should be
accepted.

Notes:
This was completed but there is one outstanding item.  The QueryUnicaster
accepts hosts as long as the *possibility* of becoming unicast-enabled
exists.  Is this a good idea?  For now I think it is OK.

Does PingReply have a accurate GGEP extension for GUESS?  Does it conform
to the latest version of the GUESS spec?

Date Resolved: 

The UDPService should not assume guess capability if it got a UDP packet
from a *private* address.

Notes:
This should be the last thing we do.  We need to accept private addresses
wholeheartheadly while testing.
