		<h1>
			Overview
		</h1>
		<p>
			These tests are integration tests for testing both the connection of
			the
			<code>
				com.limegroup.gnutella.ls.server
			</code>
			package with the
			<code>
				org.limewire.lws.server
			</code>
			, but also the this package with the rest of the Lime Wire core and
			GUI modules.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Simple tests
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are a number of tests -- those that have the same name as the
			ones in the
			<code>
				lwsserver
			</code>
			component tests that are used to assure that the authentication
			scheme still holds when you incorporate the CORE, GUI, and other
			modules.
		</p>

		<h2>
			<code>
				Handler
			</code>
			and
			<code>
				Listener
			</code>
			tests
		</h2>
		<p>
			These tests test the following invariants. Here, handler means
			<code>
				LWSManager.Handler
			</code>
			and listener means
			<code>
				LWSManager.Listener
			</code>
			.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You can only register one handler per command
				<code>
					String
				</code>
				, because each handler has to respond to a command.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can register zero or more listeners for a
				<code>
					String
				</code>
				command. They simply need to
				<i>do</i> something.
			</li>
			<li>
				After registering a handler or listener, and then sending a message
				to the LWS Manager, you should be guaranteed to have received that
				message.
			</li>
			<li>
				After unregistering a handler or listener, and then sending a
				message to the LWS Manager, you should be guaranted to have
				<b>NOT</b> received that message.
			</li>
			<li>
				The arguments that your pass the LWS Manager should be exactly those
				that are read by the handler of listeners.
			</li>
		</ul>
