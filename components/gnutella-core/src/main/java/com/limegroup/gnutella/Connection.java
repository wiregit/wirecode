/**
 * A Gnutella messaging connection.  Provides handshaking functionality and
 * routines for reading and writing of Gnutella messages.  A connection is
 * either incoming (created from a Socket) or outgoing (created from an
 * address).  This class does not provide sophisticated buffering or routing
 * logic; use ManagedConnection for that. <p>
 *
 * You will note that the constructors don't actually involve the network and
 * hence never throw exceptions or block. <b>To actual initialize a connection,
 * you must call initialize().</b> While this is somewhat awkward, it is
 * intentional.  It makes it easier, for example, for the GUI to show
 * uninitialized connections.<p>
 *
 * <tt>Connection</tt> supports only 0.6 handshakes.  Gnutella 0.6 connections
 * have a list of properties read and written during the handshake sequence.
 * Typical property/value pairs might be "Query-Routing: 0.3" or "User-Agent:
 * LimeWire".<p>
 *
 * This class augments the basic 0.6 handshaking mechanism to allow
 * authentication via "401" messages.  Authentication interactions can take
 * multiple rounds.<p>
 *
 * This class supports reading and writing streams using 'deflate' compression.
 * The HandshakeResponser is what actually determines whether or not
 * deflate will be used.  This class merely looks at what the responses are in
 * order to set up the appropriate streams.  Compression is implemented by
 * chaining the input and output streams, meaning that even if an extending
 * class implements getInputStream() and getOutputStream(), the actual input
 * and output stream used may not be an instance of the expected class.
 * However, the information is still chained through the appropriate stream.<p>
 *
 * The amount of bytes written and received are maintained by this class.  This
 * is necessary because of compression and decompression are considered
 * implementation details in this class.<p>
 * 
 * Finally, <tt>Connection</tt> also handles setting the SOFT_MAX_TTL on a
 * per-connection basis.  The SOFT_MAX TTL is the limit for hops+TTL on all
 * incoming traffic, with the exception of query hits.  If an incoming 
 * message has hops+TTL greater than SOFT_MAX, we set the TTL to 
 * SOFT_MAX-hops.  We do this on a per-connection basis because on newer
 * connections that understand X-Max-TTL, we can regulate the TTLs they 
 * send us.  This helps prevent malicious hosts from using headers like 
 * X-Max-TTL to simply get connections.  This way, they also have to abide
 * by the contract of the X-Max-TTL header, illustrated by sending lower
 * TTL traffic generally.
