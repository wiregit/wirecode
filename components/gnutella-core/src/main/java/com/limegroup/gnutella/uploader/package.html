Provides an NIO based implementation of Gnutella uploads based on the
HTTP component. The handler classes in this package respond to
HTTP requests that are matched URL patterns. Handler classes are
state-less, since all state is passed through parameters. This
includes a response object that stores the response code, headers and
an entity which provides the body of the response.
