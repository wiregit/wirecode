/**
 * Class that performs the logic of downloading a file from a single host.
 */
public class DownloadWorker {
    /*
      Each potential downloader downloader follows these steps:
      1. Establish a TCP connection to the host in the RFD.
         If unable to connect, end this execution.
         If able to connect, start a new Thread which executes the
         rest of the process.
      2. This step has two parts:
            a.  Grab a part of the file to download. If there is unclaimed area on
                the file grab that, otherwise try to steal claimed area from another 
                worker
            b.  Send http headers to the uploader on the tcp connection 
                established in step 1. The uploader may or may not be able to 
                upload at this time. If the uploader can't upload, it's 
                important that the leased area be restored to the state 
                they were in before we started trying. However, if the http 
                handshaking was successful, the downloader can keep the 
                part it obtained.
          The two steps above must be atomic wrt other downloaders. 
          Othersise, other downloaders in parallel will be  able to lease the 
          same areas, or try to steal the same area from the same downloader.
      3. Download the file by delegating to the HTTPDownloader, and then do 
         the book-keeping. Termination may be normal or abnormal.

    PUSH DOWNLOADS NOTE:
      For push downloads, the acceptDownload(file, Socket, index, clientGUI) 
      method of ManagedDownloader is called from DownloadManager.
      This method needs to notify the appropriate downloader so that it can use
      the socket. 
      
      When establishConnection() realizes that it needs to do a push, it gives the
      manager its HTTPConnectObserver (a ConnectObserver) and a mini-RFD.  When the manager
      is notified that a push was accepted (via acceptDownload) with that mini-RFD,
      it will notify the HTTPConnectObserver using handleConnect(Socket).
      
      Note: The establishConnection method schedules a Runnable to remove the observer
      in a short amount of time (about 9 seconds).  If the observer hasn't already 
      connected, it assumes the push failed and terminates by calling shutdown().
      
      If the push was done by a multicast RFD, a failure to connect will proceed to trying
      a direct connection.  Otherwise (the push was done because no direct connect was
      possible, or because a direct connect failed), the failure of a push means that the
      download cannot proceed.
      
     CONNECTION ESTABLISHMENT NOTE:
       All connection establish, push or direct, is done via callbacks.  There is no thread
       blocking on connection establishment.  When a connection either succeeds a ConnectObserver's
       handleConnect(Socket) is called, which will ultimately attempt to start the download via
       startDownload.  If the connection attempt failed, the ConnectObserver's shutdown method
       is called and no thread is ever created.
