		<h2>
			Overview
		</h2>

		<p>
			Classes in this package provide an interface to the rest of the Lime
			Wire for registering {@link LWSManager.Handler}s and {@link
			LWSManager.Listener}s to an instance of {@link LWSManager} in order
			to receive events that are sent from Javascript code coming from the
			Lime Wire Store. The main access to this one instance is through the
			method {@link com.limegroup.gnutella.LimeWireCore#getLWSManger()}
		</p>

		<p>
			The overall layout of classes in this package and those in the
			<code>
				lwsserver
			</code>
			component follows:

		<p>
			The following are the definitions of the various sub-components:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>server</em> - a web server, i.e. The Lime Wire Store web server
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>client</em> - The Lime Wire file sharing client
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>code</em> - Javascript code running in a browser sent from The
				Lime Wire Store
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>core</em> - this package
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>gui</em> - other code in the
				<code>
					gui
				</code>
				portion of the source tree, this could also be parts of the
				<code>
					core
				</code>
				part
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Components that wish to listen to commands coming from the web site
			would call {@link LWSManager#registerHandler(LWSManager.Handler)} or
			{@link LWSManager#registerListener(LWSManager.Listener)} with an
			appropriate argument. The different between the two is that there can
			only be on {@link LWSManager.Handler} and zero or more {@link
			LWSManager#Listener}s, because the former has to return a result.
		</p>

		<p>
			The purpose of these classes is to abstract out the authentication
			and communication aspect, which is taken care of by the
			<code>
				lwsserver
			</code>
			component.
