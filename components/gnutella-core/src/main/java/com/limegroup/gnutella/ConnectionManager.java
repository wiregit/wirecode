/**
 * The list of all ManagedConnection's.  Provides a factory method for creating
 * user-requested outgoing connections, accepts incoming connections, and
 * fetches "automatic" outgoing connections as needed.  Creates threads for
 * handling these connections when appropriate.  Use the setKeepAlive(int)
 * method control the number of connections; modifying the KEEP_ALIVE property
 * of SettingsManager does not automatically affect this.<p>
 * 
 * Because this is the only list of all connections, it plays an important role
 * in message broadcasting.  For this reason, the code is highly tuned to avoid
 * locking in the getInitializedConnections() methods.  Adding and removing
 * connections is a slower operation.<p>
 * 
 * ConnectionManager has methods to get up and downstream bandwidth, but it 
 * doesn't quite fit the BandwidthTracker interface.

    /*********** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS CLASS *************
     * The acceptConnection() method is a template method, and the behaviour
     * is modified in the subclasses by providing alternate implementations 
     * for the 'protected' methods called from this method, as well as from the
     * methods invoked from this method.
     *
     * Therefore, please be lenient while thinking of changing the method names
     * of the 'protected' methods of this class, as well as their use. The
     * implementation of these methods can be changed (as long as the
     * specifications are not changed.
     *
     * NOTE: Note that we could have used Template Design Pattern over here,
     * and could move the algorithm to the abstract class, but after 
     * discussions with other developers, it was observed that the subclasses
     * of this class dont really wanna provide a different implementation,
     * but want to handle special cases, and fall back on the implementations 
     * in this class for normal cases. Also, most of the methods depend a
     * lot on the private variables. Therefore having abstract class wont
     * necessarily help too much.
     * 
     * Please send an email to dev@core.limewire.org if and when you plan to 
     * change the behaviour of these methods.
