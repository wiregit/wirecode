/**
 * The list of all ManagedConnection's.  Provides a factory method for creating
 * user-requested outgoing connections, accepts incoming connections, and
 * fetches "automatic" outgoing connections as needed.  Creates threads for
 * handling these connections when appropriate.
 *
 * Because this is the only list of all connections, it plays an important role
 * in message broadcasting.  For this reason, the code is highly tuned to avoid
 * locking in the getInitializedConnections() methods.  Adding and removing
 * connections is a slower operation.<p>
 *
 * LimeWire follows the following connection strategy:<br>
 * As a leaf, LimeWire will ONLY connect to 'good' Ultrapeers.  The definition
 * of good is constantly changing.  For a current view of 'good', review
 * HandshakeResponse.isGoodUltrapeer().  LimeWire leaves will NOT deny
 * a connection to an ultrapeer even if they've reached their maximum
 * desired number of connections (currently 4).  This means that if 5
 * connections resolve simultaneously, the leaf will remain connected to all 5.
 * <br>
 * As an Ultrapeer, LimeWire will seek outgoing connections for 5 less than
 * the number of it's desired peer slots.  This is done so that newcomers
 * on the network have a better chance of finding an ultrapeer with a slot
 * open.  LimeWire ultrapeers will allow ANY other ultrapeer to connect to it,
 * and to ensure that the network does not become too LimeWire-centric, it
 * reserves 3 slots for non-LimeWire peers.  LimeWire ultrapeers will allow
 * ANY leaf to connect, so long as there are atleast 15 slots open.  Beyond
 * that number, LimeWire will only allow 'good' leaves.  To see what consitutes
 * a good leave, view HandshakeResponse.isGoodLeaf().  To ensure that the
 * network does not remain too LimeWire-centric, it reserves 3 slots for
 * non-LimeWire leaves.<p>
 *
 * ConnectionManager has methods to get up and downstream bandwidth, but it
 * doesn't quite fit the BandwidthTracker interface.
