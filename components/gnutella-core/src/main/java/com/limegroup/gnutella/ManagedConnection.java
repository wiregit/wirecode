/**
 * A ManagedConnection object represents our connection to a remote computer running Gnutella software.
 * As LimeWire runs, it has one ManagedConnection object for each computer we're connected to.
 * 
 * The ConnectionManager object keeps the list of ManagedConnection objects.
 * This is the list of computers we're connected to.
 * The ConnectionManager manages the ManagedConnection objects in its list.
 * 
 * ManagedConnection extends Connection.
 * The program never makes a Connection object, just ManagedConnection objects.
 * Connection is never used by itself, only as a part of ManagedConnection.
 * 
 * A thread runs in loopForMessages() forever, or at least until an IOException is thrown.
 * It gets Gnutella packets from this remote computer, and replies to them.
 * 
 * ManagedConnection provides a sophisticated message buffering mechanism.
 * When you call send(m), the message is not actually delivered to the socket.
 * Instead, it buffered in an application-level buffer.
 * Periodically, a thread reads messages from the buffer, writes them to the network, and flushes the socket buffers.
 * This means that there is no need to manually call flush().
 * 
 * ManagedConnection provides a simple form of flow control.
 * If messages are queued faster than they can be written to the network, they are dropped in the following order:
 * PingRequest, PingReply, QueryRequest, QueryReply, and PushRequest.
 * 
 * All ManagedConnection's have two underlying spam filters.
 * A personal filter controls what the user sees.
 * A route filter controls what the program passes on to others.
 * These filters are configured by the properties in the SettingsManager.
 * You can change them with setPersonalFilter and setRouteFilter.
 * 
 * A ManagedConnection object maintains a large number of statistics, such as the current bandwidth for upstream and downstream.
 * ManagedConnection doesn't quite fit the BandwidthTracker interface, unfortunately.
 * On the query-routing3-branch and pong-caching CVS branches, these statistics have been bundled into a single object, reducing the complexity of ManagedConnection.
 * 
 * ManagedConnection also handles various kinds of vendor messages.
 * The handleVendorMessage() works with advanced Gnutella features like hops flow, UDP connect back, and TCP connect back.
 * 
 * This class implements ReplyHandler to route pongs and query replies that originated from it.
 * 
 * Here is a summary of the contents of this class, grouped together by Gnutella feature.
 * 
 * === Use the ConnectionManager Object ===
 * 
 * _manager is a reference to the ConnectionManager object.
 * 
 * === Accepting a Connection ===
 * 
 * Use the ManagedConnection(Socket) constructor to make a new object for a remote computer that has connected to us.
 * 
 * === Connecting to an IP Address and Port Number ===
 * 
 * Use the ManagedConnection(String, int) constructor to make a new object we'll try to connect to an IP address and port number.
 * ManagedConnection(String, int, Properties, HandshakeResponder) actually makes the object.
 * initialize() connects to the remote computer, does the Gnutella handshake, and sets up compression.
 * CONNECT_TIMEOUT is 6 seconds, the amount of time we'll wait for a remote computer to accept our connection.
 * 
 * === Doing the Handshake ===
 * 
 * ConnectionFetcher.managedRun calls setLocalePreferencing(false) to have the HandshakeResponder not refuse foreign language computers.
 * 
 * === Making the Read and Write Chains ===
 * 
 * ManagedConnection inherits _socket from Connection.
 * _socket looks like a java.net.Socket object, but it's actually a LimeWire NIOSocket.
 * A NIOSocket makes four objects to use behind it, like this:
 * 
 *           - NIOInputStream  - BufferInputStream
 * NIOSocket -
 *           - NIOOutputStream - BufferOutputStream
 * 
 * NIOSocket uses this configuration and pretends to block for connecting and the handshake.
 * Downloads and uploads also use NIOSocket in this default configuration.
 * 
 * getOutputStream() puts a ThrottledOutputStream infront of the BufferOutputStream and returns it.
 * It uses _throttle to make the ThrottledOutputStream.
 * 
 * ManagedConnection, however, changes NIOSocket to use a different configuration.
 * Code here causes NIOSocket to throw away the 4 objects shown above.
 * ManagedConnection builds the chains of readers and writers, which look like this:
 * 
 *   MessageReader - InflaterReader - NIOSocket.channel
 * 
 *   MessageWriter - DeflaterWriter - DelayedBufferWriter - ThrottleWriter - SocketInterestWriteAdapter - NIOSocket.channel
 * 
 * loopForMessages() builds the chain of readers, and startOutput() builds the chain of writers.
 * 
 * === The Ultrapeer System ===
 * 
 * supernodeClientAtLooping is true if we're an ultrapeer and the remote computer is a leaf.
 * loopForMessages() sets this right after the handshake and before it builds the chain of readers.
 * 
 * === Bandwidth Throttling ===
 * 
 * TOTAL_OUTGOING_MESSAGING_BANDWIDTH is 8000 bytes/second, the limit on total upstream messaging bandwidth for all connections.
 * Both the _throttle and _nbThrottle objects use this value.
 * getOutputStream() uses _throttle to make the ThrottledOutputStream.
 * startOutput() uses _nbThrottle to make the ThrottleWriter.
 * 
 * === The Gnutella Client ID GUID ===
 * 
 * clientGUID is the remote computer's client ID, its GUID on the Gnutella network.
 * Read this value with getClientGUID().
 * 
 * === Gnutella Packets ===
 * 
 * To send a Gnutella packet to this remote computer, call send(m).
 * reply(m) just calls send(m).
 * _outputRunner is the MessageWriter we'll give the packet to.
 * Use originateQuery(QueryRequest) to send a QueryRequest packet to this remote computer that we made ourselves, or that we're sending for one of our leaves.
 * MessageReader calls processReadMessage(m) to give us a freshly sliced Gnutella packet.
 * It calls handleMessageInternal(m) to check the packet with the spam filter and hand it off to the message dispatcher.
 * The MessageReader calls getNetwork(), and we tell it we're using TCP and not UDP.
 * 
 * === Spam Filtering ===
 * 
 * A MangedConnection objects keeps two SpamFilter objects.
 * These objects look at Gnutella packets from this remote computer, and determine if they are good or if they are spam.
 * _routeFilter tells us if we shouldn't forward a Gnutella packet to other remote computers.
 * _personalFilter tells us if we shouldn't show a Gnutella packet to our user.
 * isSpam(m) uses the route filter, and isPersonalSpam(m) uses the personal filter.
 * Both of these objects are of type SpamFilter.
 * Call setRouteFilter(filter) and setPersonalFilter(filter) to set them.
 * 
 * === Query Routing Tables ===
 * 
 * Synchronize on QRP_LOCK before calling a query route table method.
 * Call getQRPLock() to access this method.
 * 
 * _lastQRPTableReceived is the remote computer's query route table.
 * _lastQRPTableSent is our query route table we sent the remote computer.
 * Access these with getQueryRouteTableReceived() and getQueryRouteTableSent().
 * Save the query route table we sent the remote computer with setQueryRouteTableSent(qrt).
 * When the remote computer sends its query route table, save it in _lastTableReceived with resetQueryRouteTable().
 * The remote computer may just send a query route table patch, patch our copy here with patchQueryRouteTable().
 * 
 * shouldForwardQuery() tests if a given query request packet will pass through or hit this remote computer's query route table.
 * hitsQueryRouteTable() makes the call to perform this test.
 * 
 * There are more methods here that give details about this remote computer's query route table.
 * getQueryRouteTablePercentFull() tells how full the remote computer's query route table is.
 * getQueryRouteTableSize() tells how big the remote computer's query route table is.
 * getQueryRouteTableEmptyUnits() tells how many units in the remote computer's query route table are empty.
 * getQueryRouteTableUnitsInUse() tells how many units in the remote computer's query route table are in use.
 * 
 * LEAF_QUERY_ROUTE_UPDATE_TIME if the remote computer is a leaf, we'll send it our query route table every 5 minutes.
 * ULTRAPEER_QUERY_ROUTE_UPDATE_TIME if the remote computer is an ultrapeer, we'll send it our query route table every minute.
 * incrementNextQRPForwardTime() uses these to set the times we should next forward a query route table to the remote computer.
 * Find out when this is with getNextQRPForwardTime(), which reads _nextQRPForwardTime.
 * 
 * MIN_BUSY_LEAF_TIME is 20 seconds, the minimum time a leaf needs to be in busy mode before we will consider it truly busy for the purpose of QRT updates.
 * isBusyEnoughToTriggerQRTRemoval() uses this busy time.
 * 
 * === Connect Back Requests ===
 * 
 * MAX_UDP_CONNECT_BACK_ATTEMPTS is 15, the maximum number of times we should send UDP connect back requests.
 * MAX_TCP_CONNECT_BACK_ATTEMPTS is 10, the maximum number of times we should send tcp connect back requests.
 * _numUDPConnectBackRequests and _numTCPConnectBackRequests are used for connect back vendor messages.
 * 
 * === Statistics ===
 * 
 * ManagedConnection keeps statistics about bandwidth and packets.
 * 
 * _upBandwidthTracker and _downBandwidthTracker are BandwidthTrackerImpl objects.
 * A thread from SupernodeAssigner calls measureBandwidth() repeatedly to keep these numbers up to date.
 * Call getMeasuredUpstreamBandwidth() and getMeasuredDownstreamBandwidth() to get the current speeds.
 * 
 * _connectionStats is a ConnectionStats object that counts how many gnutella packets we've exchanged with the remote computer, and how many we've dropped.
 * countDroppedMessage() counts another message we received and dropped.
 * getNumMessagesSent() returns the number of Gnutella packets we've sent this remote computer.
 * getNumMessagesReceived() returns the number of gnutella packets this remote computer has sent us.
 * getNumSentMessagesDropped() returns the number of packets we've sacrificed before being able to send them to keep bandwidth low.
 * getNumReceivedMessagesDropped() returns the number of packets this remote computer sent us that we then dropped or filtered out.
 * If the remote computer sent us 100 packets and then we dropped 20, getPercentReceivedDropped() returns 20%.
 * If we prepared 100 packets for this remote computer and then sacrificed 20, getPercentSentDropped() returns 20%.
 * 
 * processSentMessage(m) measures a packet to update outgoing bandwidth statistics.
 * 
 * === Hops Flow ===
 * 
 * ManagedConnection has code that performs the hops flow feature. (do)
 * hopsFlowMax is the hops flow maximum value from a HopsFlowVendorMessage this remote computer sent us.
 * Get this value with getHopsFlowMax().
 * _busyTime and setBusy() are used for hops flow.
 * isBusyLeaf() returns true if we're an ultrapeer and this remote computer is a leaf, and it told us its hops flow maximum right now is 0.
 * 
 * === Ping Reply, Push Request, and Push Proxy ===
 * 
 * _pushProxy is used for a push proxy vendor message.
 * handlePingReply() sends the given PingReply packet to this remote computer.
 * handlePushRequest() is used for QueryReply and PushRequest.
 * isPushProxy() is true if the remote computer sent a PushProxyAcknowledgement vendor message.
 * 
 * === Out of Band UDP Query Hits ===
 * 
 * A recent advanced Gnutella feature is out-of-band query hits. (do)
 * Instead of sending a query hit back through the Gnutella network, we just sent it directly with a UDP packet.
 * 
 * _guidMap maps GUIDs for this feature.
 * TIMED_GUID_LIFETIME is 10 minutes.
 * tryToProxy() and morphToStopQuery() perform the mapping.
 * handleQueryReply() has code related to this feature.
 * The nested class GuidMapExpirer was created for it.
 * 
 * === Vendor Messges ===
 * 
 * Like Connection, ManagedConnection has code related to vendor-specific Gnutella packets.
 * handleVendorMessage() sorts a vendor specific packet.
 * 
 * === Closing the Connection ===
 * 
 * Call close() to disconnect from this remote computer.
 * The messagingClosed() method lets MessageReader have ConnectionManager remove us from the list of connected computers.
 * 
 * The ConnectionWatchdog's DudChecker is allowed to kill this connection.
 * _isKillable, accessed by isKillable(), is true.
 * 
 * === Not Used With NIO ===
 * 
 * LimeWire now uses Java's new I/O, NIO.
 * NIO is non-blocking, but LimeWire's NIOSocket class uses Object.wait() and Object.notify() to create blocking behavior.
 * LimeWire classes that connect, accept connections, do the handshake, upload, and download expect this blocking behavior.
 * Gnutella connections with Gnutella packets use non-blocking NIO without simulated blocking.
 * So, LimeWire uses NIO exclusively, but created blocking behavior for many legacy classes.
 * 
 * Earlier, however, NIO was new enough that it didn't work well on Macintosh and other computers.
 * Then, LimeWire was coded so it could be released two ways: using java.net, and using java.nio.
 * There is still code here from that design.
 * Now that Connection._socket is always a NIOSocket, it is never called.
 * 
 * createDeflatedOutputStream() and createInflatedInputStream() return the stream they are given.
 * receive() and receive(int) are not used at all anymore.
 * flush() does nothing, the chain of writers will take care of moving data out.
 * The nested class BlockingRunner is also not used.
 * 
 * === Interfaces ===
 * 
 * ManagedConnection implements the ReplyHandler, MessageReceiver, and SentMessageHandler interfaces.
 * As a ReplyHandler, LimeWire lists a ManagedConnection object in a RouteTable to send pongs back where a ping came from.
 * UDPReplyHandler and ForMeReplyHandler are the two other classes that implement ReplyHandler and can do this.
 * 
 * ManagedConnection is the only class in LimeWire that implements the MessageReceiver and SentMessageHandler interfaces.
 * MessageReader is the only class that referes to the ManagedConnection it keeps as a MessageReceiver.
 * MessageWriter is the only class that referes to the ManagedConnection it keeps as a SentMessageHandler.

     * Messages are removed from the queue in a biased round-robin fashion.
     * This prioritizes some message types while preventing any one message type from dominating traffic.
