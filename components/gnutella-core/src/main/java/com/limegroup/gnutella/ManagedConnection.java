/**
 * A Connection managed by a ConnectionManager.  Includes a loopForMessages
 * method that runs forever (or until an IOException occurs), receiving and
 * replying to Gnutella messages.  ManagedConnection is only instantiated
 * through a ConnectionManager.<p>
 *
 * ManagedConnection provides a sophisticated message buffering mechanism.  When
 * you call send(Message), the message is not actually delivered to the socket;
 * instead it buffered in an application-level buffer.  Periodically, a thread
 * reads messages from the buffer, writes them to the network, and flushes the
 * socket buffers.  This means that there is no need to manually call flush().
 * Furthermore, ManagedConnection provides a simple form of flow control.  If
 * messages are queued faster than they can be written to the network, they are
 * dropped in the following order: PingRequest, PingReply, QueryRequest, 
 * QueryReply, and PushRequest.  See the implementation notes below for more
 * details.<p>
 *
 * All ManagedConnection's have two underlying spam filters: a personal filter
 * (controls what I see) and a route filter (also controls what I pass along to
 * others).  See SpamFilter for a description.  These filters are configured by
 * the properties in the SettingsManager, but you can change them with
 * setPersonalFilter and setRouteFilter.<p>
 *
 * ManagedConnection maintain a large number of statistics, such as the current
 * bandwidth for upstream & downstream.  ManagedConnection doesn't quite fit the
 * BandwidthTracker interface, unfortunately.  On the query-routing3-branch and
 * pong-caching CVS branches, these statistics have been bundled into a single
 * object, reducing the complexity of ManagedConnection.<p>
 * 
 * ManagedConnection also takes care of various VendorMessage handling, in
 * particular Hops Flow, UDP ConnectBack, and TCP ConnectBack.  See
 * handleVendorMessage().<p>
 *
 * This class implements ReplyHandler to route pongs and query replies that
 * originated from it.<p>
