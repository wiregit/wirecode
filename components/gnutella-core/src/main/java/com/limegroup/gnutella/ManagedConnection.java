/**
 * A Connection managed by a ConnectionManager.  Includes a loopForMessages
 * method that runs forever (or until an IOException occurs), receiving and
 * replying to Gnutella messages.  ManagedConnection is only instantiated
 * through a ConnectionManager.<p>
 *
 * ManagedConnection provides a sophisticated message buffering mechanism.  When
 * you call send(Message), the message is not actually delivered to the socket;
 * instead it buffered in an application-level buffer.  Periodically, a thread
 * reads messages from the buffer, writes them to the network, and flushes the
 * socket buffers.  This means that there is no need to manually call flush().
 * Furthermore, ManagedConnection provides a simple form of flow control.  If
 * messages are queued faster than they can be written to the network, they are
 * dropped in the following order: PingRequest, PingReply, QueryRequest, 
 * QueryReply, and PushRequest.  See the implementation notes below for more
 * details.<p>
 *
 * All ManagedConnection's have two underlying spam filters: a personal filter
 * (controls what I see) and a route filter (also controls what I pass along to
 * others).  See SpamFilter for a description.  These filters are configured by
 * the properties in the SettingsManager, but you can change them with
 * setPersonalFilter and setRouteFilter.<p>
 *
 * ManagedConnection maintain a large number of statistics, such as the number
 * of bytes read and written.  On the query-routing3-branch and pong-caching CVS
 * branches, these statistics have been bundled into a single object, reducing
 * the complexity of ManagedConnection.  We will likely merge this change into
 * ManagedConnection in the future, so please bear with this for now.<p>
 * 
 * This class implements ReplyHandler to route pongs and query replies that
 * originated from it.<p>

     *  streams.  sock, in, and out are null iff this is in the

     *  important that this only be modified by the send(m) and
     *  receive() methods.
     *
     *  This implementation has two goals:
     *    1) a slow connection cannot prevent other connections from making
     *       progress.  Packets must be dropped.
     *    2) packets should be sent in large batches to the OS, but the
     *       batches should not be so long as to cause undue latency.
     *
     *  Towards this end, we queue sent messages on the front of
     *  outputQueue.  Whenever outputQueue contains at least
     *  BATCH_SIZE messages or QUEUE_TIME milliseconds has passed, the
     *  messages on outputQueue are written to out.  Out is then
     *  flushed exactly once. outputQueue is fixed size, so if the
     *  output thread can't keep up with the producer, packets will be
     *  (intentionally) droppped.  LOCKING: obtain outputQueueLock
     *  lock before modifying or replacing outputQueue.
     *
     *  One problem with this scheme is that IOExceptions from sending
     *  data happen asynchronously.  When this happens, _connectionClosed
     *  is set to true.  Then the next time send is called, an IOException
     *  is thrown.
