	/** 
	 * Conventions for String names representing structural information
	 * of corresponding fieldnames in XML Schema/Documents:
 	 * Canonicalization:
     * <p>
     * So as to preserve the structure, Structure.Field will be represented as
     * Structure__Field (Double Underscore is being used as a delimiter to
     * represent the structure).
     *<p>
     * In case of multiple structured values with same name,
     * as might occur while using + or * in the regular expressions in schema,
     * those should be represented as using the array index using the __
     * notation (withouth the square brackets)
     * for e.g. myarray[0].name ==> myarray__0__name
     *
     * attribute names for an element in the XML schema should be postfixed 
     * with __ (double underscore).
     * So element.attribute ==> element__attribute__
     *
     * @return a List <NameValue>, where each name-value corresponds to a
     * canonicalized field name (placeholder), and its corresponding value in
     * the XML Document.
