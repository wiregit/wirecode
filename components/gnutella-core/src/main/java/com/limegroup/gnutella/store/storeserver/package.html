			This is the main sub-package for store serevr integration.  There is one instance
			of the store server (<code>IStoreServer</code>) in <code>RouterService</code>, and one can
			attach one handler for a particular command, and zero or more listeners for a certain command.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A <code>IStoreServer.Handler</code> will respond to a command with a <code>String</code> response.
			A <code>IStoreServer.Listener</code> will <b>not</b> respond to a command but will simply do <em>something</em>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			An example of adding a listener would be the following.  Here we add a listener
			to receive events called <em>Play</em> and then call the method <code>play()</code>,
			assuming it's defined somewhere.
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		<pre>
RouterService.getStoreServer().registerListener("Play", new AbstractListener("play") {
  public void handle(Map&lt;String, String&gt; args) {
    MediaPlayerComponent.instance().play();
  }
});
		</pre>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
			Likewise, we could register a handler to report back the state of the current player.	
		</p>
		
		<blockquote>
		<pre>
RouterService.getStoreServer().registerHandler("GetState", new AbstractListener("get.state") {
  public String handle(Map&lt;String, String&gt; args) {
    return MediaPlayerComponent.instance().getStateString();
  }
});
		</pre>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
			Note.  That <em>Play</em> and <em>play</em> (as well, <em>GetState</em> and <em>get.state</em>) are not the 
			same and don't need to.  The capitlized ones refer to the command to which this handler or listener will react;
			the lower case ones are just names, which currently aren't used.
