/** 
 * Limits throughput of a stream to at most N bytes per T seconds.  Mutable and
 * thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * In the following example, <tt>throttle</tt> is used to send the contents of
 * <tt>buf</tt> to <tt>out</tt> at no more than <tt>N/T</tt> bytes per second:
 * <pre>
 *      BandwidthThrottle throttle=new BandwidthThrottle(N, T);
 *      OutputStream out=...;
 *      byte[] buf=...;
 *      for (int i=0; i<buf.length; ) {
 *          int allowed=throttle.request(buf.length-i);
 *          out.write(buf, i, allowed);
 *          i+=allowed;
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 * This class works by allowing exactly N bytes to be sent every T seconds.  If
 * the number of bytes for a given window have been exceeded, subsequent calls
 * to request(..) will block.  The default value of T is 100 milliseconds.
 * Smaller window values T allow fairer bandwidth sharing and less noticeable
 * pauses but may decrease efficiency slightly.<p>
 *
 * Note that throttles are <i>not</i> cumulative.  In the future, this may allow
 * enable fancier control.  Also, BandwidthThrottle may be able delegate to
 * other throttles.  This would allow, for example, a 15 KB/s Gnutella messaging
 * throttle, with no more than 10 KB/s devoted to uploads.<p>
 * 
 * This implementation is based on the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/freenet/freenet/src/freenet/support/io/Bandwidth.java">Bandwidth</a> 
class from 
 * the Freenet project.  It has been simplified and better documented.<p>
