                           -------------------


This proposal describes a mechanism that will allow for Gnutella Query
Replies (aka Query Hits) to be delivered to interested parties
'out-of-band' - specifically, servents would deliver Query Replies
directly to the originator of the query as opposed to placing them on the
Gnutella net for eventual delivery to the originator.  Fundamentally,
servents would open a direct (TCP) connection to the Query originator and
dump the Query Replies in the originator's lap.

Some may raise the objection that this goes against the grain of the
Gnutella model - each Gnutella servent maintains a routing table (from
GUIDs to links) to specifically route traffic appropriately.  Some of this
maintenance would be unnecessary if all Query Replies are delivered
'out-of-band'.  Here are a few reasons why 'out-of-band' delivery of Query
Replies is a good idea:

  * QueryReply traffic is taking up a larger percentage of Gnutella
    traffic as the popularity of Gnutella grows.  Reducing some of this
    traffic would free up resources for other vital messaging necessary
    for a healthy Gnutella net.

  * Sending Query Replies 'out-of-band' is a purely optional enhancement.
    Clients that support 'out-of-band' delivery may choose how to send
    back any Replies (ie if the cost of an 'out-of-band' transaction is
    too high at the moment, then the servent can use the traditional
    mechanism).  This flexibility is a strength and is enforced by the use
    of the GGEP scheme to advertise 'out-of-band' support.

  * The 'out-of-band' scheme is fault-tolerant in the face of network
    topology changes.  If the originator loses vital links during the
    processing of a Query, Query Replies that are routed directly to the
    originator will still reach the desired destination.
