                          SACHRIFC Algorithm
                          ==================
      (Sergieu and Chris' Flow Control, pronounced "sacrifice")


Steps
+don't reorder OTHER
+basic round-robin implementation 
+add ratios
        -by volume
        -fractional
-add timeouts.  Don't forget to increment drop count (see
-add GUID prioritization (yay heap!)
+refactor.  
        +Make OutputRunner smaller.
        +can we use an array of smart object for each priority level?
-optimize:
        -add size INVARIANT (sum of all buffers), changed queued()
        -avoid inner loop for common case ratio
-change GUI to eliminate race condition displaying results.
-cap max througput, using OutputStream


Per priority level:
-LIFO or FIFO
-buffer size
-name
-predicate for matching messages
-ratio
-expire time (if any)
-time or binary heap
