This exposition details the requirements for the wishlist functionality.

Goal: To provide the LimeWire user with a tool that allows for flexible
downloading of a file.  If a search garners results, the user simply
reverts back to the old style (manual selection of the needed file(s)).
If a search does not yield any results, they will have a 'wishlist'
option.  Selecting this option will spawn a download with no source file -
the download will requery the network at regular intervals until a match
is found, and then the match will be downloaded.

GUI Layout: The 'Download Any' and 'Download All' button will be replaced
by one button.  The button will alternately read 'Add To WishList' and
'Download'.  If a search tab with no results is 'tabbed', the button will
read the former.  As soon as one result for the search appears, the button
will change its label to 'Download'.
If the 'Add To WishList' button is pressed, a DownloadDataLine will appear
with Filename equal to the search string (only non-xml) and a size unknown
'?'.  Once a candidate is found, the DataLine will assume the role of the
more traditional DataLine.

Backend Behavior/Implementation Notes: Not definite yet, but will involve
moving the use of an AutoDownloadDetail from DownloadManager to
ManagedDownloader.
