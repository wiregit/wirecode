One of the more complicated things happening in this component is mixed
memory management between java (through jna) and c. Whenever we return
an item from c, depending on how it has been allocated we need to call a
corresponding free() method for that object to free up the memory in c.
<p>There are a couple of scenarios we are dealing with.
<ol>
	<li>The memory is completely allocated in c code, but is returned
	through a method.</li>
	<p>After the object gets into java and is read, it is effectively
	copied, so we can call free on the object right away without any ill
	effects, so long as we don't need to use that object in the c code
	again.</p>
	<li>The memory is completely allocated in c code, but calls a java
	callback with then returns to the c code after the callback finishes.</li>
	<p>In this instance the object is copied into java as a part of the
	callback, but then the object returns to the c code, in these cases we
	have been freeing the memory using delete directly after the callback.</p>
	<li>The memory for a struct is allocated in java, the struct is
	passed by reference to the c code as part of a method call. In this
	method more memory is allocated and pointers are filled in in the
	struct. Under this circumstance the memory is mixed, because structs
	created via jna are freed when the java object representing them is
	garbage collected. It cannot know how to free the internal pointers
	however. So we additionally will call free on the object after the
	fields have been read.</li>
</ol>
